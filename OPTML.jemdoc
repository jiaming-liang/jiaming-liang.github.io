= Optimization for Machine Learning, Fall 2023

This course primarily focuses on algorithms for large-scale optimization problems arising in machine learning and data science applications. The first part will cover first-order methods including gradient and subgradient methods, mirror descent, proximal gradient method, accelerated gradient method, Frank-Wolfe method, and inexact proximal point methods. The second part will introduce algorithms for nonconvex optimization, stochastic optimization, distributed optimization, manifold optimization, reinforcement learning, and those beyond first-order.
